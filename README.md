# Machine Learning 

This repository highlights my experience and skills with different supervised learning models, providing practical insights into their applications and implementations.

## Linear Regression

- **Model Fundamentals**: Implemented linear regression to predict continuous numerical outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized visual tools to interpret regression coefficients and model fits.

*Goal*: Understand and implement linear relationships within datasets to predict numerical values effectively.

## Logistic Regression

- **Binary Classification**: Applied logistic regression to classify binary outcomes.
- **Probability Interpretation**: Interpreted results in terms of probabilities, odds ratios, and log-odds.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated classification accuracy using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall metrics.

*Goal*: Gain proficiency in predicting categorical outcomes and interpreting logistic models.

## Random Forest and XGBoost

- **Ensemble Methods**: Explored ensemble learning with Random Forest and gradient boosting with XGBoost for enhanced predictive performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conducted grid searches and cross-validation to optimize model parameters.
- **Model Interpretability**: Employed feature importance metrics to understand predictive drivers.

*Goal*: Learn advanced machine learning techniques for complex, non-linear prediction tasks and robust model performance.
